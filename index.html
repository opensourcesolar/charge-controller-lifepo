        <h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>The charge controller is made for the <a href="http://blog.opensource-solar.org">Opensource-solar.org</a> project which is about designing open source hardware for pico photovoltaic systems.</p>

<p>The goal is to design a system for about 15 USD which can provide electricity for LED lighting, mobile phone charging and other small appliances which lasts at least 15 years.</p>

<h3>Charge controller technical design goals</h3>

<p>The charge controller has a 8 cell photovoltaics panel as its input, which delivers approximately 1 A at 4 V. This charges a LiFePo4 battery (starting at 3.2 V, 2.2 Ah up to bigger sizes with 10-20 Ah).
The MSP430 microcontroller on the charge controller board prevents over charging and deep discharging by sampling the battery voltage. It also controls the two outputs which are a LED light and a DC/DC converter which delivers 5V @ 1A for charging mobile devices. The built-in capacitive touch peripherals of the microcontroller are used for switching the light and the charger on and off.</p>

<h3>Current state</h3>

<p>Several prototypes exist. The most promising design will be uploaded shortly and then improved upon.</p>
