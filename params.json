This charges a LiFePo4 battery (starting at 3.2 V, 2.2 Ah up to bigger sizes with 10-20 Ah).\r\nThe MSP430 microcontroller on the charge controller board prevents over charging and deep discharging by sampling the battery voltage. It also controls the two outputs which are a LED light and a DC/DC converter which delivers 5V @ 1A for charging mobile devices. The built-in capacitive touch peripherals of the microcontroller are used for switching the light and the charger on and off.\r\n\r\n### Current state\r\n\r\nSeveral prototypes exist. The most promising design will be uploaded shortly and then improved upon.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nContact @opensourcesolar if you need help or want to help us.","tagline":"MSP430 based single cell LiFePo4 charge controller for photovoltaic applications; designed for low cost, robustness, easy soldering and hackability","google":""}
